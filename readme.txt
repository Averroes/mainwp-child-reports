The MainWP Child Report plugin tracks Child sites for the MainWP Client Reports Extension. The plugin is only useful if you are using MainWP and the Client Reports Extension.

== Description ==

**Note: This plugin requires PHP 5.3 or higher to be activated.**

Install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child/">MainWP Child</a> plugin first.

The MainWP Child Report plugin allows you to know exactly when changes to your site have been made, and more importantly, who did them. Never be in the dark about WP Admin activity again.

Every logged-in user action is logged in a user activity report and organized for easy filtering by connector, context, action and IP address.

Built with performance in mind, MainWP Child Reports won't pollute your default posts table with records or slow down content querying on your site.
